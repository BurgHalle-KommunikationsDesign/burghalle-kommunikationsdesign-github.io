## Description

A.k.a **Hypertext Markup Language**<br>
HTML is the markup language of websites.
Markup means that you give meaning to a structure,
you describe in a manner machines can understand what you mean.
You define elements like

- headlines
- parapgraphs
- lists
- links
- images
- boxes
- ...

These elements are called tags. Tags can be styled with [CSS](/basics/css) to build complex layouts by nesting them inside and alongside each other.

## Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <div>
      This is a box
      <div>Inside another box</div>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```
