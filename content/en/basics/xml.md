## Description

A.k.a **Extensible Markup Language**<br>
XML is a general markup language used to hierarchically structure data. It's not a single language in particular, but more a set of rules to describe other languages. [HTML](/basics/html) and [SVG](/basics/vectors) are based on XML.

## Example
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
  <to>Students</to>
  <from>Fabian</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Stay hydrated!</body>
</note>
```
