## Description

Every type of image serves a slightly different purpose.
New image types are invented occasionally to tackle common problems.
We are dealing with **pixel based** images here, **vector based** formats and introduced in [Vectors](/basics/vectors).

## List of image types

- [JPG / JPEG](#jpeg)
- [PNG](#png)
- [GIF](#gif)
- [TIFF](#tiff)
- [WebP](#webp)

## JPEG
Joint Photographic Experts Group<br>
A JPEG is a standardized compressing method to exchange images.
Most likely data will be lost while compressing.
You want to use this format for photography.

## PNG
Portable Network Graphics<br>
PNG is a lossles data compression file format.
You want to use this format for graphics with few colors or typography.

## GIF
Graphics Interchange Format<br>
GIF is a lossless data compression file format, which can handle multiple layers to build sequences.
You want to use this format for short animations.

## TIFF
Tagged Image File Format<br>
TIFF is a lossles data format for images.
It's capabale of holding much more information than a JPEG, which makes the files a lot larger.
You want to use this format for raw photography.

## WebP
Web Picture<br>
WebP is a lossless *or* lossy compression for images. It's 20 years younger than JPEG and was invented 2010 by Google. Most of the time WebP images are shorter in file size than JPEG while keeping the quality up and not starting to make artefacts.
