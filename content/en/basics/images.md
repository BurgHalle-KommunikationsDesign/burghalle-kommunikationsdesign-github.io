## Description

We have different types of images. All serve a slightly different purpose.
Also new image types are invented occasionally to tackle common problems.
Although you probably know of SVG and EPS, these are **vector based** formats and introduced in [Basics/Vectors](/basics/vectors/). We are dealing with **pixel based** images here.

## List of image types

- JPG / JPEG
- PNG
