## Description

Python can be used not only for web development but also in many different fields:
Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and the Internet of Things.
Like [PHP](/advanced/php) it runs server-side and can be used to pre-process files.
For us it's most likely interesting because it's the language [Processing and DrawBot](/making/a-vector) is written in.

## Example

```
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

Outputs

```
5
John
```
