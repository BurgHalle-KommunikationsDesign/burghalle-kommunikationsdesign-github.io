## Dear Students and Teachers

This website documents the most frequently asked questions regarding code within the context of communication-design at the [Burg Giebichenstein Kunsthochschule Halle](https://www.burg-halle.de/).

It's not made to be a completed guide to every aspect of websites, but more as a starting and inspiration point for those interested to work and explore with code.

Nonetheless a lot of explanations come with code examples to reproduce a minimum viable product / prototype.

At the moment its just me:
