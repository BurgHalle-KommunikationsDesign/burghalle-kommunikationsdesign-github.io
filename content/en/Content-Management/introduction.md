## Description

Building more extensive website can be hard when working with static HTML / CSS / JS files and folder structures. A Content Management System (CMS) can be handy to automate different tasks.

The basic idea is to have one base location of your content, either as a real **database** like MySQL in Wordpress or as a **folder structure** like in Kirby. Most likely this database can be edited through a **user interface**, so the editor does not have to write code to modify the contents of a website.
