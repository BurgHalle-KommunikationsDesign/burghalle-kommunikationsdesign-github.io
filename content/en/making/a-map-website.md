## Description

Originating from a project of Prof. Matthias GÃ¶rlich, we put together an easy to use framework for a tiled map website. A tiled map website is comparable to Google Maps, where you have different zoom levels and the possibilities to set interactive markers within the coordinates (langitude and longitude).

## Tools

- Leaflet https://leafletjs.com/
- GDAL2Tiles for Leaflet https://github.com/commenthol/gdal2tiles-leaflet

## Sourcecode

Download the source code from this github repo:<br>
https://github.com/BurgHalle-KommunikationsDesign/burghalle-map

## How To

### 1. The Repository

`Download and unzip the repository.`

If you are familiar with git you can also clone it directly from github.
The repository consists of the following folders and files:

- **_gdal2tiles-leaflet-master** Includes *gdal2tiles.py* which we use to slice our source image into tiles.
- **assets** Includes CSS and Javascript files to make the website work
- **index.html** Our entry HTML file
- **README.md** Hold information about how the repository can be used
- **tiles** Includes all tiles. Empty at first.

### 2. Source image

`Copy any JPG or TIFF image to the _gdal2tiles-leaflet-master folder`

`Rename it to image.jpg or image.tif`

You can use any JPG or TIFF. The image will be split up into 256 x 256 px square PNG tiles.
Best practice is to size your source image so its devideable by 256 and follows the tile pattern.
For example if you want to do 5 zoom levels your source image should have at least 4096 x 4096 px.
8 zoom levels require the source image to be 32768 x 32768 px.

Level | Size | Tiles | Total
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 256 x 256 | 1x1 | 1
2 | 512 x 512 | 2x2 | 4
3 | 1024 x 1024 | 4x4 | 16
4 | 2048 x 2048 | 8x8 | 64
5 | 4096 x 4096 | 16x16 | 256
6 | 8192 x 8192 | 32x32 | 1024
7 | 16384 x 16384 | 64x64 | 4096
8 | 32768 x 32768 | 128x128 | 16384

### 3. Python

`Download and install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/`

### 4. Tiles

For this step you will need the *Terminal* on Mac or the *Command Line* on Windows.

#### Mac
`Open Terminal`

`Drag & Drop the _gdal2tiles-leaflet-master folder onto the Terminal icon`

We will use commands to use the python script. Copy and paste each of the following and press enter afterwards.

This actions is only needed once. It installs needed packages<br>
`pip install .`

Use this to slice your image, generating tiles, you can do this as often as you want<br>
`python gdal2tiles.py -l -p raster -z 0-6 image.jpg ../tiles`

If you have a TIFF you have to change .jpg to .tif<br>
`python gdal2tiles.py -l -p raster -z 0-6 image.tif ../tiles`

#### Windows
Cannot be tested, but should work like the Mac instructions.
Please give feedback.


#### Files & Folder Structure
Your tiles are now being generated by the Python script. The following structure is build:

`/{zoom-level}/{x-axis}/{y-axis}.png`

### 5. Finishing
You will find your *tiles* folder now populated with numeric folders.<br>
Open *index.html* in your browser.
