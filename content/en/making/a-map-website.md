## Description

Originating from the **Marchetti** project of Prof. Matthias GÃ¶rlich, we put together an easy to use framework for a tiled map website.
A tiled map website is comparable to Google Maps, where you have different zoom levels and the possibilities to set interactive markers within the coordinates (langitude and longitude).
