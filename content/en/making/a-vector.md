## Description

We are not limited to make [(Scaleable) Vector Graphics / SVGs](/basics/vectors) with Adobe Illustrator.
We can use code to build them. As SVGs are based on XML we can use [CSS](/basics/css) to style and [JS](/basics/js) to interact with them.

The two most prominent frameworks — there are probably many many more — to do so are **Processing** and **DrawBot**.

While both can be used for different purposes, **DrawBot** is more used in the world of **Typography**, while **Processing** is more used in the world of **Generative Design & Creative Coding**.

## Tools

- Processing: https://processing.org/
- DrawBot: https://www.drawbot.com/

## How To

Will follow soon.
