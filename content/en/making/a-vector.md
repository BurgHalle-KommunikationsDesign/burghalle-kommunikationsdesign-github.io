## Description

We are used to make [(Scaleable) Vector Graphics / SVGs](/basics/vectors) with Adobe Illustrator.
On the other hand we can use scripts to build them with code.

The two most prominent, there are probably many many more ways, are **Processing** and **DrawBot**.

While both can be used for different purposes, **DrawBot** is more used in the world of **Typography**, while **Processing** is more used in the world of **Generative Design & Creative Coding**.
