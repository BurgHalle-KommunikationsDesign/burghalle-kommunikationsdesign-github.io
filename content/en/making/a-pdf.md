## Description

It's worth to mention that with **Processing** and **DrawBot** we can not only make vector graphics as described in [Making a Font](/making/a-font), but also we can export our canvas as a PDF.

Besides both Python frameworks above, we additionally can use the PHP framework *MPDF* to generate a proper PDF from HTML.

## Tools

- DrawBot: https://www.drawbot.com/
- Processing: https://processing.org/
- MPDF: https://processing.org/

## How To

Will follow soon.
