## Description

Its worth to mention that with **Processing** and **DrawBot** we can not only make vector graphics as descripted in [Making a Font](/making/a-font), but also we can export our canvas as a PDF.

Besides both the Python frameworks above, we can use a PHP framework called Mpdf to generate a proper PDF from HTML.
